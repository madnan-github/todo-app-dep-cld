# API Contract: Health Check Endpoints

## Overview
This document defines the API contracts for health check endpoints required for Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes.

## Frontend Health Check Endpoint

### Endpoint: `GET /health`
**Purpose:** Verify frontend service is operational and responding to requests.

#### Request
- Method: `GET`
- Path: `/health`
- Headers: None required
- Query Parameters: None
- Request Body: None

#### Response
- Success Response: `200 OK`
  - Content-Type: `application/json`
  - Body:
    ```json
    {
      "status": "healthy",
      "timestamp": "2026-01-20T15:30:00Z",
      "service": "frontend",
      "version": "0.1.0"
    }
    ```
- Error Responses:
  - `503 Service Unavailable` if the service is not ready

#### Implementation Notes
- Should respond quickly (under 2 seconds as per spec)
- Should verify the web server is operational
- Should not perform heavy computations

## Backend Health Check Endpoint

### Endpoint: `GET /api/health`
**Purpose:** Verify backend service is operational and its dependencies are accessible.

#### Request
- Method: `GET`
- Path: `/api/health`
- Headers: None required
- Query Parameters: None
- Request Body: None

#### Response
- Success Response: `200 OK`
  - Content-Type: `application/json`
  - Body:
    ```json
    {
      "status": "healthy",
      "timestamp": "2026-01-20T15:30:00Z",
      "service": "backend",
      "version": "0.1.0",
      "checks": {
        "database": "connected",
        "external_apis": "accessible"
      }
    }
    ```
- Error Responses:
  - `503 Service Unavailable` if the service or dependencies are not healthy

#### Implementation Notes
- Should verify database connectivity if applicable
- Should respond quickly (under 2 seconds as per spec)
- Should not perform heavy database operations

## Health Check Standards Compliance

### Kubernetes Probe Configuration
Based on these endpoints, the following Kubernetes probe configurations should be used:

#### Liveness Probe
- Initial delay: 30 seconds
- Period: 10 seconds
- Timeout: 5 seconds
- Success threshold: 1
- Failure threshold: 3

#### Readiness Probe
- Initial delay: 5 seconds
- Period: 5 seconds
- Timeout: 3 seconds
- Success threshold: 1
- Failure threshold: 2

## Implementation Requirements
- Endpoints must return HTTP 200 status when service is healthy
- Response time must be under 2 seconds (as specified in feature requirements)
- Endpoints should be secured and not expose sensitive information
- Should be available even when other parts of the application are experiencing issues
